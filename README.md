# Council of High Intelligence

A Claude Code skill that convenes historical thinkers for multi-perspective deliberation on complex problems.

LLMs make you think they are smart, but when things get complex their reasoning can fall short. This council uses structured disagreement between diverse intellectual traditions to surface blind spots, challenge assumptions, and produce better decisions.

## The 11 Council Members

| Agent | Figure | Domain | Model | Polarity |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| `council-aristotle` | Aristotle | Categorization & structure | opus | Classifies everything |
| `council-socrates` | Socrates | Assumption destruction | opus | Questions everything |
| `council-sun-tzu` | Sun Tzu | Adversarial strategy | sonnet | Reads terrain & competition |
| `council-ada` | Ada Lovelace | Formal systems & abstraction | sonnet | What can/can't be mechanized |
| `council-aurelius` | Marcus Aurelius | Resilience & moral clarity | opus | Control vs acceptance |
| `council-machiavelli` | Machiavelli | Power dynamics & realpolitik | sonnet | How actors actually behave |
| `council-lao-tzu` | Lao Tzu | Non-action & emergence | opus | When less is more |
| `council-feynman` | Feynman | First-principles debugging | sonnet | Refuses unexplained complexity |
| `council-torvalds` | Linus Torvalds | Pragmatic engineering | sonnet | Ship it or shut up |
| `council-musashi` | Miyamoto Musashi | Strategic timing | sonnet | The decisive strike |
| `council-watts` | Alan Watts | Perspective & reframing | opus | Dissolves false problems |

## Polarity Pairs

The members are chosen as deliberate counterweights:

- **Socrates vs Feynman** — Both question, but Socrates destroys top-down; Feynman rebuilds bottom-up
- **Aristotle vs Lao Tzu** — Aristotle classifies everything; Lao Tzu says structure IS the problem
- **Sun Tzu vs Aurelius** — Sun Tzu wins external games; Aurelius governs the internal one
- **Ada vs Machiavelli** — Ada abstracts toward formal purity; Machiavelli anchors in messy human incentives
- **Torvalds vs Watts** — Torvalds ships concrete solutions; Watts questions whether the problem exists
- **Musashi vs Torvalds** — Musashi waits for the perfect moment; Torvalds says ship it now

## Pre-defined Triads

| Domain | Triad | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `architecture` | Aristotle + Ada + Feynman | Classify + formalize + simplicity-test |
| `strategy` | Sun Tzu + Machiavelli + Aurelius | Terrain + incentives + moral grounding |
| `ethics` | Aurelius + Socrates + Lao Tzu | Duty + questioning + natural order |
| `debugging` | Feynman + Socrates + Ada | Bottom-up + assumption testing + formal verification |
| `innovation` | Ada + Lao Tzu + Aristotle | Abstraction + emergence + classification |
| `conflict` | Socrates + Machiavelli + Aurelius | Expose + predict + ground |
| `complexity` | Lao Tzu + Aristotle + Ada | Emergence + categories + formalism |
| `risk` | Sun Tzu + Aurelius + Feynman | Threats + resilience + empirical verification |
| `shipping` | Torvalds + Musashi + Feynman | Pragmatism + timing + first-principles |
| `product` | Torvalds + Machiavelli + Watts | Ship it + incentives + reframing |
| `founder` | Musashi + Sun Tzu + Torvalds | Timing + terrain + engineering reality |

## Exploration-First Profile: `exploration-orthogonal`

For discovery and "you don't know what you don't know" exploration, start with this 8-member panel:

- Socrates (assumption destruction)
- Feynman (mechanistic first principles)
- Sun Tzu (adversarial dynamics)
- Machiavelli (incentives/power realism)
- Ada (formalization and limits)
- Lao Tzu (emergence/non-forcing)
- Aurelius (ethics and downside containment)
- Torvalds (execution and shipping constraints)

Why this profile works:
- High epistemic separation across normative, strategic, empirical, formal, emergent, and operational perspectives
- Better unknown-unknown discovery than a purely aligned panel

Profile-specific triads:
- `unknowns` → Socrates + Lao Tzu + Feynman
- `market-entry` → Sun Tzu + Machiavelli + Aurelius
- `system-design` → Ada + Feynman + Torvalds
- `reframing` → Socrates + Lao Tzu + Ada

## Execution-First Profile: `execution-lean`

For fast decision-to-action loops, use this 5-member panel:

- Torvalds (shipping pragmatism)
- Feynman (mechanistic correctness)
- Sun Tzu (competitive strategy)
- Aurelius (risk and downside guardrails)
- Ada (formal rigor where needed)

Suggested execution triads:
- `ship-now` → Torvalds + Feynman + Aurelius
- `launch-strategy` → Sun Tzu + Torvalds + Machiavelli (optional substitute)
- `stability` → Ada + Feynman + Aurelius

## Multi-provider / Multi-model exploration

Use `--models` to provide seat-to-provider mapping and reduce model monoculture.

Rules of thumb:
- spread seats across providers first, then across model families
- avoid putting obvious polarity pairs on the same provider when possible
- run Round 1 blind-first (no peer outputs)
- force a counterfactual round if early consensus exceeds ~70%

Starter template: `configs/provider-model-slots.example.yaml`

## Usage

```
/council [problem description]
/council --triad architecture Should we use a monorepo or polyrepo?
/council --full What is the right pricing strategy for our SaaS product?
/council --members socrates,feynman,ada Is our caching strategy correct?
/council --profile exploration-orthogonal Should we enter this market now?
/council --profile exploration-orthogonal --models configs/provider-model-slots.example.yaml Evaluate our roadmap assumptions
/council --profile execution-lean --triad ship-now Should we ship this release candidate today?
```

## Deliberation Protocol

0. **Round 0: Provider/Model Routing (optional)** — Load model slots from `--models` and maximize provider separation across seats.
1. **Round 1: Independent Analysis (blind-first)** — All selected members analyze the problem in parallel (400 words max each)
2. **Round 2: Cross-Examination** — Members challenge each other sequentially (300 words, must engage 2+ others)
3. **Round 3: Synthesis** — Final 100-word position statements. Socrates gets one last question.

Anti-recursion enforcement prevents Socrates from infinite questioning. Anti-convergence enforcement requires dissent quota + counterfactual pass when agreement forms too early. Tie-breaking uses 2/3 majority with domain expert weighting.

## Installation

```bash
./install.sh
```

Optional flags:

```bash
# Install into a non-default Claude config directory
./install.sh --claude-dir /path/to/.claude

# Preview actions without modifying files
./install.sh --dry-run

# Also install model routing templates into ~/.claude/skills/council/configs
./install.sh --copy-configs
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Copy agents
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp agents/council-*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Copy skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/council
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/council/SKILL.md
```

Then restart Claude Code. The `/council` command will be available immediately.
